ViewFu
======

ViewFu is a Rails plugin that provides all the miscellaneous View tasks. It's a combination of the functionality of Styler, Javascripter, and Headline (from Patrick Crowley, the.railsi.st) - along with additional tweaks such as providing commonly used View Helpers Methods.

ViewFu HTML Helpers
=======
ViewFu provides helpers for commonly used html elements

br #=> <br />
hr #=> <hr />
anchor("posts") #=> <a name='posts'></a>
clear #=> <div class="clear"></div>
clear(:left) #=> <div class="clearleft"></div>
clear_tag(:br) #=> <br class="clear" />
lorem #=> Lorem ipsum dolor...


ViewFu Helper Queries
=======
production? #=> returns true if Rails.env == "production"
is_new? #=> returns true is we're on a "new" or "create" action
is_edit? #=> returns true is we're on an "edit" or "update" action
use_cache? #=> returns true if perform_caching is turned on


ViewFu Misc Helpers
=======
paging(@array) #=> display a will_paginate paging links (only if the array is a valid paging collection)
paging(@array, :sabros) #=> wrap the paging links with a class "sabros"


Haml Specific Helpers
=======
Haml allows you to pash a hash of attributes. ViewFu assists this by providing a simple "hidden" helper that allows you to conditionally hide page elements.

%div{hidden} #=> <div style="display:none">
%div.posts{hidden_if(@posts.empty?)} #=> hide the .posts div if the array is empty
%p.empty{hidden_unless(@posts.empty?)} #=> hide the empty posts message if the array has elements


Stylesheets
=======
ViewFu allows you to add a dynamic stylesheets collection to the top of your page. If you have any partials that depend on a stylesheet, they just need to call add_stylesheet(path) and the styles will be available on the page. 

You'll just need to add a call *stylesheets* somewhere your page header. 

stylesheets
writes the stylesheet collection to html

stylesheet
alias around stylesheet_link_tag

stylesheet_folder(path) 
lets you include a recursive folder of stylesheets

page_stylesheets
output stylesheets specific to a page

add_stylesheet(path)
adds a stylesheet to the collection to be included on the page

ignore_stylesheet(path)
removes a stylesheet from the collection to be included on the page

See lib/stylesheet/README for more details


Javascripts
=======
ViewFu allows you to add a dynamic javascript collection to the top(or bottom) of your page. Now, if you have a partial that depends on a javascript library, you can just include it via add_javascript(path) and it will appear on the top of your page.

You'll just need add a call to *javascripts* to your layout and the javascripts you included an all your partials will appear.

javascripts
writes the javascript collection to html

javascript
alias around javascript_include_tag

javascript_folder(path) 
lets you include a recursive folder of javascripts

page_javascripts

add_javascript(path)

ignore_javascript(path)

ViewFu allows you to easily set the current page title from anywhere on your views

See lib/headliner/README for more details


Meta Tags
=======
ViewFu allows you to set meta tags on your page header from anywhere. Just add a call to meta_tags somewhere in your page header.

More Plugins
======

If you like ViewFu, you'll *love* FormFu. It provides a beautiful way to generate tableless Rails html forms. Works just like form_for, except it'll generate the entire XHTML (label, wrapper, validation message, etc).
